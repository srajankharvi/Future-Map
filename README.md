## Recommendation Algorithm

The system scores careers and courses based on three factors:

1. **Skill Matching (up to 60 points)** — Each selected skill maps to relevant careers/courses
2. **Academic Performance (-20 to +30 points)** — Marks-based scoring with granular tiers
3. **Education Level Bonus (+10 points)** — Careers suitable for the user's education level get a bonus

**Score thresholds:**
- Marks below 30 → No recommendations returned
- Careers need a score above 20 to be shown
- Courses need a score above 15 to be shown
- Top 5 results returned for each, sorted by score

- **Typography:** Clean, modern font stack
- **Layout:** Fully responsive — mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **UI Elements:** Cards, modals, tabs, search filters, sliders
